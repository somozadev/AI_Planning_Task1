1) The BT of the enemies: ----fixed
	Sometimes (as when the air enemy attack range is < 100) the decorator returns false and the bt stops. 

2) Sight pawn sensing: ----fixed
	For some reason, the BP_Obstacle doesn't block sight to ai pawn sensing... 

3) Planners: 
	What's the task exactly? Adding conditions for each bt to act for planner1 and planner2 ?   Make a commander of some kind that limits tasks to other units? i'm not sure
